# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Automatic Deployment

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: master
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ master ]

  #   Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #   workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      #   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: "14.x"

      # # 拉取代码
      # - name: Checkout
      #   uses: actions/checkout@v2
      #   with:
      #     persist-credentials: false

      # 生成静态文件
      - name: Build
        run: npm install && npm run docs:build

          # BRANCH: master
